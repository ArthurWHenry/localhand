# localhand

## Introduction

localhand is a project started by Adriana Sasso, Ellie Lane, Karla Escobar, and
Arthur Henry during Florida International University's ShellHacks in Fall 2020.
We started this project with the intention to help small, local businesses in
the area interact with the community through the use of Twitter.

For the purpose of the hackathon and to have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product),
we kept the data static and not stored in the database. It was an easier option
based on the level of experience we collectively had together at that point in
time.

To visit the application, you can visit this link: https://localhand.vercel.app/.
